## Issue Approval Process

To ensure that all issues are valid, necessary, and not duplicates, we follow a structured approval process:

1. **Group Meetings**:
   - New issues will be discussed during our weekly group meetings and/or in our communication channels.
   - Team members will provide feedback, suggest modifications, and collectively approve the issues.

2. **Delegated Approval**:
   - All team members are responsible for reviewing and approving new issues.

3. **Comment-Based Approval**:
   - An issue requires at least 2 team members to comment "approved" before work can begin.
   - Team members should review the issue details, check for duplicates, and ensure all necessary information is provided before commenting their approval.

All approved issues will be documented in our project tracker via the wiki and assigned to team members as appropriate.

## Pull Request Approval Process

To ensure that all pull requests are properly reviewed, validated, and adhere to the project standards, we follow a structured approval process:

1. **Group Meetings**:
   - New pull requests will be discussed during our weekly group meetings and/or in our communication channels.
   - Team members will provide feedback, suggest modifications, and collectively approve the pull requests.

2. **Delegated Approval**:
   - All team members are responsible for reviewing and approving pull requests.

3. **Comment-Based Approval**:
   - A pull request requires at least 1 team member to comment "approved" before it can be merged.
   - Reviewers should:
     - Check for code quality, readability, and adherence to coding standards.

4. **Final Approval and Merge**:
   - After receiving the necessary approvals, the reviewer will:
     - Squash commits into a single commit to maintain a clean commit history.
     - Resolve any merge conflicts.
     - Merge the pull request into the main branch.
   - The reviewer will notify the team once the merge is complete.

5. **Post-Merge**:
   - After merging, the reviewer will delete the feature branch to keep the repository tidy.
   - Verify that the changes have been successfully merged and that the main branch is stable.

All approved pull requests will be documented in our project tracker via the wiki and any associated issues will be updated accordingly.
